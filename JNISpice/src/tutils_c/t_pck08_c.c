-Procedure t_pck08_c (Create a test PCK file)

-Abstract
 
     Create, and if appropriate, load a test PCK kernel.  The kernel
     created by this routine is meant to contain data consistent with
     the equations implemented in the test utility routine t_pckeq.

-Brief_I/O
 
    VARIABLE  I/O  DESCRIPTION 
    --------  ---  -------------------------------------------------- 
    namepc     I   The name of the PC-kernel to create 
    loadpc     I   Load the PC-kernel if SPICETRUE 
    keeppc     I   Keep the PC-kernel if SPICETRUE, else delete it. 
 
-Detailed_Input
 
   namepc      is the name of a PC-kernel to create and load if 
               loadpc is set to SPICETRUE.  If a PC-kernel of the same 
               name already exists it is deleted. 
 
 
   loadpc      is a logical that indicates whether or not the PCK 
               file should be loaded after it is created.  If it 
               has the value SPICETRUE the PC-kernel is loaded after 
               it is created.  Otherwise it is left un-opened. 
 
 
   keeppc      is a logical that indicates whether or not the PCK 
               file should be deleted after it is loaded.  If keeppc 
               is SPICETRUE the file is not deleted.  If keeppc is 
               SPICEFALSE the file is deleted after it is loaded.  Note 
               that unless loadsc is SPICETRUE, the PCK file is not 
               deleted by this routine.  This routine deletes the 
               PC-kernel only if it loadsc is SPICETRUE and KEEPPC is 
               SPICEFALSE.

-Particulars
 
   This routine creates a planetary constants file for use in
   testing.  The data in the PCK are those contained in the
   draft version of the kernel pck00008.tpc as of 2004-09-10. 
 
-Examples
 
   This is intended to be used in those instances when you
   need a well defined PC-kernel for use in testing.  By using
   this routine you can avoid having to know in advance where
   a PCK file is on the system where you plan to do your testing.
