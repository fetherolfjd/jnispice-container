  <body>
The Alpha Test JNISpice system is a prototype of "JNISpice":
an object-oriented Java interface to the C-language SPICE 
Toolkit CSPICE library. 

<p>This version of the Alpha Test JNISpice system is based on the
N0066 version of CSPICE.


<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>This prototype JNISpice system is available to the NAIF team
and volunteer testers to enable experimentation and review, with the aim of 
finalizing the specification and design of the system.

<p> Reviewers of this prototype should already be familiar with
the SPICE system and the Java language. 
Documentation provided in this Toolkit is not adequate
to make the system easily usable by SPICE novices.

<p>JNISpice provides Java applications access to CSPICE
via Java's "native interface" (JNI) capability. JNISpice
provides both a high-level, object-oriented Java interface,
and a low-level Java interface consisting of native methods.
Native methods are implemented via C-language wrappers
for CSPICE functions.

<p> All JNISpice Java and C source code files are included in this Toolkit.

<p> The primary documentation for JNISpice is a set of HTML
pages generated from JNISpice source code comments via the
javadoc utility.

<p> JNISpice contains a built-in regression test capability.
See the cover letter for this product release for details.

<p> Below, links are provided to JNISpice classes that contain
complete example programs. Inspection of these programs 
may be one of the quickest ways to understand the JNISpice public
API. Examination of both the API and regression test source code
may also be helpful.

<h2> Status </h2>

<p>This prototype system is at an "alpha test" level of maturity. 
At this stage, significant changes may still be made to the 
system's public interface, prior to the release of the system's first 
official version. As with all other SPICE Toolkits, once an
official version has been released, the initial public interface will
be supported for the life of the system.

<p> A significant number of 
changes to the top-level Java API are planned:
the known deficiencies listed below in the 
section titled "Technical Issues"
will be corrected. The review 
process likely will result in further updates.

<p> The design of the C wrapper layer is thought to be 
close to completion; only minor error handling 
enhancements are planned at this point.

<p> At this early stage of JNISpice development,
little effort has been expended on documentation of the API
layer. Each class and method has at
least a one-line description, but only a small
subset of the key APIs have more detailed documentation.
See the section below titled "Documentation" for links to
headers that contain example programs.

<p> A Java-based regression test system called "JNITspice"
is included in this system. JNITspice is intended to exercise
all of the methods of JNISpice's API-level classes: these
are the classes in package {@link spice.basic}. However, JNITspice
has not been reviewed by the NAIF team and cannot be 
guaranteed to completely test all of the code it's meant
to cover.



<h2> Design </h2>

<p> JNISpice consists of three packages:
<ul>
<li> {@link spice.basic}: API classes
<li> {@link spice.testutils}: test utilities 
<li> {@link spice.tspice}: test procedures 
</ul>

<p> While JNISpice provides functionality similar to that
offered by other SPICE language versions, the object-oriented
design of this system may appear somewhat foreign to experienced SPICE
users. Key SPICE functionality is now provided by public methods
of classes; the names of these methods don't match those of corresponding
routines in other SPICE language versions. However, JNISpice class names
are often based on nouns familiar to SPICE users: for example "Body," 
"aberration correction," "reference frame," and "state vector."

<p> Most of the high-level functionality familiar to SPICELIB
or CSPICE users is provided by classes in the package {@link spice.basic}.
Classes in this package include (but are not limited to) those providing
position and state vector computations, time conversions, reference 
frame transformations, coordinate system conversions, and vector
and matrix arithmetic. New users may benefit by first examining the
class {@link spice.basic.StateRecord}, which is a principal
component of JNISpice's version of the SPK "read access" API. Documentation for
classes on which StateRecord depends can be found by following
hyperlinks.

<p> While JNISpice's API is object-oriented, JNISpice implements
much of its functionality via calls to the CSPICE shared object
library.  The native methods that make these calls belong
to the class {@link spice.basic.CSPICE}.

<p>While spice.basic.CSPICE is 
a low-level class, it is considered part of the public API.
Application developers who wish to bypass JNISPICE's object-oriented
API may program calls to the methods of this class.


<h3>Mapping Traditional SPICE APIs to JNISpice APIs</h3>

The JNISpice design departs from tradition SPICE
APIs and naming conventions, and it may not be obvious where
to look to find a functional equivalent to a desired API.

A mapping from some commonly used SPICE subsystems to JNISpice
classes that provide corresponding APIs is shown below:
<ul>
<li> Kernel loading and unloading: {@link spice.basic.KernelDatabase}
<li> SPK reading: {@link spice.basic.StateRecord}
<li> CK reading:  {@link spice.basic.PointingRecord},
          {@link spice.basic.PointingAndAVRecord}
<li> Time conversion (including SCLK conversions): 
subclasses of {@link spice.basic.Time}
<li> Reference frames: {@link spice.basic.ReferenceFrame}
<li> Constant time functions: {@link spice.basic.TimeConstants}
<li> 3-d Vector math: {@link spice.basic.Vector3}
<li> 6-d Vector math: {@link spice.basic.Vector6}
<li> 3x3 Matrix math: {@link spice.basic.Matrix33}
<li> 6x6 Matrix math: {@link spice.basic.Matrix66}
<li> Euler angles: {@link spice.basic.EulerAngles},
                   {@link spice.basic.EulerState}
<li> Osculating elements: {@link spice.basic.OsculatingElements}
<li> Coordinate conversions: subclasses of {@link spice.basic.Coordinates}
<li> GF searches: subclasses of {@link spice.basic.GFNumericSearch},
{@link spice.basic.GFBinaryStateSearch}
<li> Kernel pool access: {@link spice.basic.KernelPool} and {@link spice.basic.Body}
</ul>

A mapping from a few of the most commonly used
SPICE routines to JNISpice methods is shown below:
<ul>
<li> FURNSH: {@link spice.basic.KernelDatabase#load( java.lang.String file )}
<li> SPKEZR: {@link spice.basic.StateRecord#StateRecord(Body target,
Time t, ReferenceFrame ref, AberrationCorrection abcorr,
Body observer)}
<li> STR2ET: {@link spice.basic.TDBTime#TDBTime(java.lang.String str )}
<li> TIMOUT: {@link spice.basic.TDBTime#toString(java.lang.String picture )}
<li> PXFORM: {@link spice.basic.ReferenceFrame#getPositionTransformation(
ReferenceFrame toFrame, Time t)}
</ul>

<h2> Documentation </h2>

The Alpha Test JNISpice documentation as it stands does <b>not</b> represent
a proposed level of completeness; it may be just enough to
enable SPICE experts to understand the software design.

<p>This set of HTML pages was generated 
by the javadoc utility. Javadoc generates most of the 
documentation text by extracting comments from source code 
files. A small amount of additional text, such as
this overview discussion, is drawn from stand-alone HTML files.

<p> Some examples of more complete JNISpice documentation do 
currently exist. For some classes, for example
<ul>
<li> {@link spice.basic.DAF}
<li> {@link spice.basic.DLA}
<li> {@link spice.basic.FOV}
<li> {@link spice.basic.EllipsoidPlaneIntercept}
<li> {@link spice.basic.GFAngularSeparationSearch}
<li> {@link spice.basic.GFDistanceSearch}
<li> {@link spice.basic.GFIlluminationAngleSearch}
<li> {@link spice.basic.GFOccultationSearch}
<li> {@link spice.basic.GFPhaseAngleSearch}
<li> {@link spice.basic.GFPositionCoordinateSearch}
<li> {@link spice.basic.GFRangeRateSearch}
<li> {@link spice.basic.GFRayInFOVSearch}
<li> {@link spice.basic.GFSubObserverCoordinateSearch}
<li> {@link spice.basic.GFSurfaceInterceptCoordinateSearch}
<li> {@link spice.basic.GFTargetInFOVSearch}
<li> {@link spice.basic.IlluminationAngles}
<li> {@link spice.basic.LimbPoint}
<li> {@link spice.basic.OccultationState}
<li> {@link spice.basic.StateRecord}
<li> {@link spice.basic.SurfaceIntercept}
<li> {@link spice.basic.SurfaceInterceptWithDSKInfo}
<li> {@link spice.basic.SurfacePoint}
<li> {@link spice.basic.SubObserverRecord}
<li> {@link spice.basic.SubSolarRecord}
<li> {@link spice.basic.TerminatorPoint}
</ul>
there are one or more code examples at the class level; these
are often a good starting point for understanding use of a
class of interest.

<p>An example
of centralization of documentation is provided by class 
{@link spice.basic.AberrationCorrection}. Note that the
current documentation for this class has not yet been fully
adapted for JNISpice:  the text still contains obsolete references
such as "this routine."  


<h2> Technical Issues</h2>

<p> A list of known technical issues and deficiencies is included below.

<pre>
 
Alpha Test JNISpice Technical Issues and Deficiencies
==============================================================================
 
 
February 16, 2010
 
   This document presents known questions and problems relating to the design,
   implementation, testing, and documentation of the Alpha Test JNISpice
   Toolkit.
 
   For some issues, a brief rationale for a design or implementation choice is
   stated. The question of whether the choice is correct is implied.
 
 
Known API issues
----------------------------------------------------------
 
 
String parameters
 
   Many JNISpice classes declare public String constants. Better compile-time
   checking of user application code could be achieved if these constants were
   implemented via classes.
 
   Note that many String constants cannot be conveniently implemented via
   enums because the constants' values don't conform to variable name syntax
   rules.
 
 
Lack of thread safety
 
   All JNISpice native methods are declared static and synchronized. However,
   these methods must still be considered ``not thread safe'' since the
   underlying C code relies heavily on static variables.
 
   It is unlikely that this limitation will be removed in a future version of
   JNISpice, since by its design, JNISpice relies on CSPICE for all but the
   most trivial computational capabilities.
 
 
Use of package-private or protected class members
 
   Some classes such as Vector3 contain package-private members. The obvious
   alternate design calls for declaring these members private and providing
   accessor methods.
 
   The rationale is that the selected privacy option simplifies the
   implementation, increases efficiency of simple operations, and does not
   pose a serious risk of misuse by application developers.
 
 
Package and class names
 
   The JNISpice package names may be revised in the first official JNISpice
   Toolkit.
 
   Many JNISpice class names are quite long and make source code formatting
   cumbersome. Some of these classes may need to be renamed as well.
 
 
Method names
 
   NAIF plans to replace ``traditional'' matrix-vector arithmetic names such
   as ``mxm'' and ``mxv'' with mnemonic names such as ``add,'' ``sub'' and
   ``mult''; these names will be overloaded, and their meaning will be
   indicated by the object to which they are applied. For example, the method
   call m.mult( v ) will invoke matrix-vector multiplication if m is of class
   Matrix33 and v is of class Vector3, while m0.mult(m1) invokes matrix
   multiplication if both m0 and m1 are of class Matrix33.
 
   Are there problems with this approach, other than the lack of
   cross-language compatibility of names?
 
 
Output encapsulation classes
 
   Certain classes that exist only to encapsulate lists of methods' outputs
   could be withdrawn. For example, the EllipsoidPointNearPoint class serves
   only to package the results of the point/ellipsoid ``near point''
   computation: a surface point and an altitude. It's not clear that the small
   convenience of having the altitude computed automatically is worth the
   additional system complexity resulting from having an additional class.
 
   Classes that encapsulate a combination of return values and ``found'' flags
   are not candidates for removal.
 
 
Variation of API patterns
 
   Some closely related APIs have unexpected deviations from ``natural''
   parallel functionality. For example, the EulerAngles class contains two
   ``getAngles'' methods: one that accepts an angular unit specifier and one
   that does not. The EulerState class contains only the version of the
   ``getAngles'' method that doesn't accept a unit specifier.
 
   These variations must be rectified in the official JNISpice Toolkit.
 
 
GF search API design
 
   Geometry Finder (GF) searches are set up via several steps, rather than
   implemented by one method call that requires as many as 25 input arguments.
 
   While this interface pattern doesn't have a tight, parallel relationship to
   the corresponding CSPICE API pattern, it has the advantages of providing
   far simpler method signatures and greater modularity.
 
 
Lack of full support for intermediate-level GF APIs
 
   Currently no APIs are provided to mimic the functionality of CSPICE's
   gfevnt_c and gffove_c APIs.
 
   This is a deficiency that must be rectified in the official JNISpice
   Toolkit.
 
 
No default GF interrupt handling support
 
   Unlike CSPICE, the JNISpice GF system doesn't trap control-C inputs by
   default when interrupt handling is enabled for the intermediate-level GF
   occultation search method.
 
   Some type of default GF interrupt handling capability should be added in
   the official JNISpice Toolkit. Would a simple GUI interface for this be
   useful?
 
 
Default GF progress report uses console I/O
 
   Should this be changed to a GUI interface?
 
 
No general dimension vector or matrix support
 
   No APIs are provided to mimic the functionality of CSPICE's
   general-dimension vector and matrix functions.
 
   Most of what are thought to be common applications of these functions are
   supported by the classes Vector6 and Matrix66.
 
   Should general-dimension APIs be added?
 
 
Visibility of support classes
 
   Certain support classes, such as BodyCode and KernelVarDescriptor, perhaps
   should be made private or should be moved to a different package.
 
 
Exception classes
 
   Should there be only one JNISpice exception class?
 
   In any case, the use of JNISpice exception classes is currently not well
   organized and should be cleaned up.
 
 
Support for toString
 
   Currently, a small set of JNISpice classes override class Object's toString
   method. Most, perhaps all JNISpice classes should override this method.
 
   Formatting conventions used in JNISpice's toString methods need to be
   standardized.
 
 
Limited support for numeric forms of UTC
 
   No top-level API support is provided for ``UTC seconds past J2000'' or
   ``UTC Julian date.''
 
   Due to inherent defects of these UTC-based time representations, it doesn't
   make sense to represent them via JNISpice classes analogous to the existing
   JNISpice TDBTime or JED classes.
 
   Currently, the only API that supports UTC seconds past J2000 is method
   deltet of the low-level class CSPICE.
 
   Some sort of top-level API support is needed.
 
 
Use of constructors rather than factory methods
 
   The heavy use of public constructors as the principal means of creating
   most JNISpice objects may appear to be a questionable implementation
   choice.
 
   The main points in favor of this choice are:
 
            --   The constructor-based design is simple and appears to allow
                 critical applications, such as state vector computations, to
                 run at reasonable speeds.
 
            --   The public APIs are not allowed to change, so flexibility in
                 selecting new subclasses of returned objects in later
                 versions of JNISpice appears to be of no value.
 
            --   Factory methods can be added later if a need for
                 application-specific memory management becomes apparent. This
                 is considered to be unlikely.
 
 
Class SpiceWindow
 
   Some aspects of the API of this class need work. Some common SpiceWindow
   operations, such as creation of windows representing time intervals, are
   awkward.
 
 
Class GFConstraint
 
   Some aspects of the API of this class need work. Possibly this class should
   have subclasses for the different types of constraints.
 
 
Class SCLK
 
   Possibly this class should be renamed---the current name leads to code that
   can be confusing to read.
 
 
Classes SPK and CK
 
   Possibly the coverage summary methods of these classes should be made more
   parallel to their CSPICE counterparts.
 
 
No support for EK APIs
 
   Due to expected sparse use of the EK APIs, support for these in JNISpice is
   considered a low priority.
 
   Is this correct?
 
 
C-layer error handling
 
   JNISpice C-layer utilities could do a better job of diagnosing invalid
   inputs, such as null pointers.
 
 
Documentation issues
----------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Required Reading files
 
   Currently only CSPICE versions of Required Reading files are available.
 
   JNISpice versions are needed.
 
 
Permuted index
 
   No analog of CSPICE's permuted index is available for JNISpice.
 
   Is a JNISpice version needed?
 
 
``Most Used'' Routines
 
   No analog of CSPICE's ``most used routines'' document is available for
   JNISpice.
 
   Is a JNISpice version needed?
 
 
Class documentation
 
   Most JNISpice classes have no documentation; full SPICE-quality
   documentation is needed.
 
 
Method documentation
 
   The situation for methods is pretty much the same as for classes.
 
 
Package documentation
 
   Packages lack overview documentation.
 
 
Host compatibility issues
----------------------------------------------------------
 
 
The host system must use JDK version 1.5 or greater.
 
   It is not known how many potential JNISpice users will be inconvenienced by
   this restriction.
 
 
Java header files
 
   For the convenience of NAIF developers, the Java header files jni.h and
   jni_md.h are provided in the JNISpice Toolkit. This is not an acceptable
   design for the official JNISpice Toolkit: JNISpice build procedures should
   reference the header files provided by the host system's Java installation.
 
 
Test issues
----------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Coverage
 
   Coverage provided by the JNITspice regression test system has not been
   analyzed.
 
 
Memory leakage
 
   Rigorous testing of JNISpice's dynamic memory usage has not been performed.
 
   JNISpice utility code could do a better job of checking for memory leaks.
 
 
Lack of review
 
   JNITspice test methods have not been reviewed by NAIF staff.
 
 
Implementation Issues
----------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Lack of coding standards
 
   NAIF has no official coding standard for Java source code.
 
   One issue that would be addressed by such a standard is that of naming
   conventions for identifiers used in Java source code.
 
 
Class DAF
 
   Implementation is awkward---may need re-writing.
