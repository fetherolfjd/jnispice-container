#   mkjnijava script for JNISpice Java code; PC/Linux/64bit version.
#
#   This script builds JNISpice Java classes. It should be executed
#   from the JNISpice directory in the following tree:
#
#                      package
#                         |
#                         |
#       +------+------+------+------+------+
#       |      |      |      |      |      |
#     data    doc    etc    exe    lib    src
#                                          |
#                                          |
#                         +----------+----------+------- ... ------+
#                         |          |          |                  |
#                     JNISpice  product_2  product_3    ...   product_n
#
#   Upon execution it does the following:
#
#     1)  Deletes all .class files from the subdirectories under
#         ``cspice'' directory, the current directory. Deletes from
#         ``../../exe'' directory all .class files that were also
#         present the current directory.
#
#     2)  Compiles all .java source files in the current directory and
#         under the subdirectories under the ``cspice'' directory.
#
#     3)  Copies all re-compiled .class files from the current
#         directory to the ``../../exe''.
#
#   The Java compiler used by the script is set using environment
#   variable JAVACOMPILER. If this variables is set prior to executing
#   this script, that Java compiler is used. If this variable is not
#   set prior to executing this script, it is set within the script as
#   a local variable.
